### Information
Virtual environment named "MyEnv" was used on my Windows 11 Computer using command line, in the virtual environment I ran Python 3.11.0. I ran the virtual enviornment using the command, in the project folder:
    > MyEnv\Scripts\activate

Development environment was command prompt, Visual Studio Code, and Git.

To run the program on the command line the way I did, after the virtual enviornment is running, use the command:
    > python.exe search.py

I did not use any other packages in the development of this project.

After the programming is running, just follow the directions on the command line. To run the program, re-enter the command above. I unfortunately did not implement a user-prompt for restarting the program.
